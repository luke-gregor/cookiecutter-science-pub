# Writing your manuscript

This is where you can put your LaTeX files. 

If you want to use overleaf, this is a good place to do that! 
1. Create the project on [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com) using the template of the journal you'd like to publish in
2. Navigate to the Menu button in the top left of the project and under the `Sync` section click `Git`. This will bring up a window. Copy the command `git clone https://git.overleaf.com/<unqiue_id>`.
3. Navigate to the `./writing` folder in your project repo in the terminal. Paste the command from above to create the repo locally
4. Rename the folder (called `<unique_id>`) to something like `manuscript`

You can now update the changes using `git`. 

With these steps you can easily work on your document locally.
