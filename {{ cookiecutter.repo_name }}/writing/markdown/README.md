Only sub folders in the markdown directory will be used.

Folder names will be headings for the table of contents
Contained markdown files will be the contents.
Note that files and folders will be aranged alphabetically or numerically, but leading numbers followed by a full stop (1.) will be removed from the headings for the table of contents.
